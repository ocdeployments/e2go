# e2go.app — Build Tracker & Session Handoff

**Last Updated:** June 5, 2026 — End of Session S5
**App Name:** e2go.app
**Stack:** Next.js 14 · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS · Supabase · Claude API
**Dev URL:** https://e2go-git-dev-ocdeployments-projects.vercel.app
**Repo:** github.com/ocdeployments/e2go
**Branch:** dev (never commit to main directly)
**Project Path:** ~/E2-go

---

## SESSION COMMANDS

**To start:** type `start session`
**To end:** type `end session`

On start: read CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md + BUILD_TRACKER.md +
docs/DESIGN_REFERENCE.html (if UI work). BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE — READ THIS:

Two API keys are present in .env.local:
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY — use this for ALL app AI features
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY — use this ONLY for document generation

Do NOT switch any existing OpenRouter calls to the Anthropic API.
Do NOT use ANTHROPIC_API_KEY anywhere except:
  - src/lib/generation-engine.ts (document generation calls)
  - The humanization pass in the same file

If Claude Code asks "should I use the Anthropic API key?" — the answer is:
Only for document generation. Everything else stays on OpenRouter.

Confirm you understand this before proceeding.Report status.
Ask "Ready to confirm and begin?" before any work.

On end: update this file, update CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md if rules
changed, run npm run build:clean, report summary.

## ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS — LOCKED

| Decision | Rule |
|---|---|
| Paywall timing | After Module 3 personal tabs complete, before generation |
| Document generation | Sequential — ONE at a time. Checkpointed. Never parallel. |
| Cover letter order | Generated FIRST (Step 1) — officer's roadmap |
| AI for documents | Anthropic Claude API direct (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) |
| AI for app features | MiniMax via OpenRouter — server-side only |
| Supabase auth | auth.users → public.profiles (never public.users) |
| Data storage | Answers only. Never store passports, bank statements |
| Document ownership | Each fact lives in exactly ONE document. No repetition. |
| e2go branding on docs | NEVER on submitted documents |
| Page limit | 50 pages per TAB (Toronto). Not 50 total. |
| Prompt storage | Versioned .md files in /prompts/v1/documents/ |
| Partnership routing | Two complete separate packages generated |
| Form terminology | Exact DS-160/U.S. government terminology always |
| Interview limits | 2 simulator sessions included. Extra: $9.99/3-bundle |
| Stats | Real government data only. Never fabricated. |
| Global scope | 82 treaty countries. No Canada-only assumptions. |

## COMPONENT BACKLOG — UI POLISH (Magic MCP — 21st.dev)

These components have been sourced and assessed. Code is saved in
docs/components/. Integrate in the sessions listed below.

| Component | Source File | Where in App | Session |
|---|---|---|---|
| Animated Gradient Border | docs/components/animated-gradient-border.md | Pricing Most Popular card, Landing CTA button, Module 3 active sidebar | Polish session after Session 16 |
| Image Slider Login | docs/components/image-slider-login.md | /verify page, /login, /signup | Already applied (Session 15B) — revisit for polish |
| FAQ Monochrome | docs/components/faq-monochrome.md | Landing page FAQ section (new section needed) | Polish session after Session 16 |
| AI Generation Reveal | docs/components/ai-generation-reveal.md | Document generation screen — blur-lift effect per document | Session 16 — generation progress page |

### Animated Gradient Border — Implementation Notes
- Colors: primary #8B6914, secondary #C9A84C, accent #E8D5A3
- backgroundColor: #0a0a0a
- borderRadius: 0 (no rounded corners — locked rule)
- borderWidth: 1
- Apply to: pricing Most Popular card (speed 10), landing CTA button
  (speed 6, rotate-on-hover), Module 3 active sidebar section (speed 12)
- CSS: add @keyframes gradient-rotate + @property --gradient-angle to globals.css
- Component path: src/components/ui/animated-gradient-border.tsx

### Image Slider Login — Implementation Notes
- Split screen: image slider left, form right
- Left images: U.S. themed — Statue of Liberty, New York skyline, business settings
- Right: signup/login form with pre-filled email on /verify
- Uses framer-motion (fine on auth pages — not SEO-critical)
- Dependencies: framer-motion (already installed)
- Apply Obsidian Gold tokens — no white backgrounds, no rounded corners

### FAQ Monochrome — Implementation Notes
- New section needed on landing page between Testimonials and Footer
- Questions to answer: "Is this a law firm?", "What if I'm denied?",
  "How is this different from hiring an attorney?", "Is my data secure?",
  "What countries are eligible?", "How long does it take?"
- Swap white accent → #C9A84C for gold
- Dark palette only — remove light mode toggle (locked to dark)
- Animated intro pill + card glow on hover → keep both

### AI Generation Reveal — Implementation Notes
- Use on /generate/[applicationId] progress page (Session 16)
- Wire progress prop to SSE percentage from generation pipeline
- Each document preview reveals with blur-lift as it completes
- Replace the right-panel "live document preview" in Session 16 Step 6
  with this component instead of a plain scrolling text panel
- Dependencies: motion (npm install motion)

## SESSION 15A — Build the Analysis Engine
- Database tables (migration created)
- Types (src/types/analysis.ts)
- Engine logic (src/lib/analysis-engine.ts)

- Sarah Mitchell test case (src/lib/__tests__/analysis-engine.test.ts)
Status: COMPLETE

---

## SESSION 15F — Quiz Scoring Wiring Fix (June 3, 2026)
- Found: `calculateAndRedirect` in `src/app/quiz/page.tsx` initialised `hardStopCodes`, `attorneyFlags`, `riskFlags` to empty arrays — outcome was always `'qualified'` regardless of answers
- Fixed: real evaluation against `module0_scoring_logic.json` (hard_stops, attorney_flags, risk_flags)
- Supports array triggers (string match) and string triggers with arithmetic (`amount_usd < 75000`, `75000 <= amount_usd <= 149999`)
- Attorney flags with `level: "do_not_proceed"` route their `stop_code` into `hardStopCodes` (W-03 → PR-THIRD-COUNTRY)
- Widened `ScoringLogic` interface: `trigger: string | string[]`
- Build: clean (`/quiz` route 6.91 kB → 7.2 kB)
- Commit: `8002b17 Fix: quiz scoring logic — wire actual evaluation from module0_scoring_logic.json`
Status: COMPLETE

---

## SESSION 15B — Email Verification Funnel (June 3, 2026)

Status: COMPLETE

---

## SESSIONS 13G + 15C–15E — Quiz & Results Completion (June 3, 2026)
- Module 3 Tabs E, G, H, I, K, L wired (Session 13G, commits 4041f0c → 89a7680)
- Quiz completion: email send + redirect on Q0-21 (2c5a733)
- Results page rebuild: 4 outcomes + email capture banner (2d1ac64)
- Results page recovery after stream error (d4dadba)
- Build clean: all TypeScript and ESLint errors fixed (b4f3d55)
Status: COMPLETE

---

## SPEC CORRECTIONS — June 3, 2026
All 6 spec corrections applied and committed:
1. Cover letter = Step 1 always (Spec3, Spec4)
2. Page limit = 50 per TAB not total (Spec1, Spec4)
3. AI model = Anthropic API direct (Spec3)
4. Prompt storage = /prompts/v1/documents/ (Spec3)
5. Partnership routing = two separate packages (all specs)
6. Voice profile = raw text only, no JSON (Spec2)
Status: COMPLETE

---

## SESSION 16 — Document Generation Engine (June 4, 2026)

Completed:
- 6 generation prompt files created (`/prompts/v1/documents/`)
- Database migration: 5 tables with RLS (`document_generation_jobs`, `generated_documents`, `revision_credits`, `document_change_log`, `document_generation_log`)
- Types defined (`src/types/generation.ts`) — `GenerationJob`, `GeneratedDocument`, `RevisionCredit`, generation step labels
- Core generation engine (`src/lib/generation-engine.ts`) — prompt loading, payload building, Claude API calls, humanization pass, consistency checker, quality gate, main orchestrator with 15-step pipeline
- 4 API routes: `POST /api/generate/start`, `GET /api/generate/progress/[jobId]` (SSE), `GET /api/generate/documents/[applicationId]`, `POST /api/generate/run/[jobId]`
- Progress page (`/generate/[applicationId]`) — 15-step narrative, live document preview, Obsidian Gold design
- Documents review page (`/documents/[applicationId]`) — document cards, approval modal, revision requests, 5-checkbox acknowledgment gate
- Module 3 overview page rewritten (`/apply/module3`) — tab completion tracking, "Generate My Package" button
- 8 unit tests (Sarah Mitchell case) — all passing
- `npm run build`: clean — 39 routes compiled
- Anthropic SDK (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) installed, Jest configured

Decisions:
- AI model for documents: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` via Anthropic SDK (not OpenRouter)
- Cover letter always generated first (Step 1)
- 15-step pipeline: sequential only, checkpointed after each step
- SSE + polling fallback for progress
- Revision credits: 10 per application
- 5 acknowledgment checkboxes required before download

Status: COMPLETE

## BUILD STATE — End of Session 17 (S1-S3), June 4, 2026
- Branch: `dev`
- Working tree: clean
- Last commit: `37491e0` — feat: pricing page pre-selects correct tier from quiz session data
- `npm run build`: clean — 41 routes, 0 errors
- 8/8 unit tests passing (generation-engine.test.ts), 7/7 passing (pricing-tier.test.ts)
- Quiz v3.0: live, scoring wired
- Module 3: all 12 tabs (A–L) wired, overview page with generate button
- Analysis engine: built and tested
- Document generation engine: fully built
- Generation progress UI: built
- Documents review + approval page: built
- Pricing page: pre-selects tier from quiz session data, 7-tier mapping, manual override supported, Playwright verified

---

## SESSION 6, 7 & 8 — Business Data & Security History Deduplication (June 5, 2026)
- **Completed S6**: Audited Tab A for work history/education; confirmed Tab J is the single source of truth. Added clarifying comment to `src/app/apply/module3/a/page.tsx` and documented in `docs/IDEAS.md`.
- **Completed S7**: Established Tab A as the single source of truth for business details (`M3-A-51` for business name, `M3-A-55` for ownership percentage). Created `ContradictionFlag` component to detect and resolve mismatches between master and derived fields. Updated Tab E page to pre-fill from Tab A. (Commit: `c2719b3`)
- **Completed S8**: Security history pre-fill with legal confirmation gate on Tab A. Extended `src/lib/prefill.ts` mappings and `PreFilledField.tsx` to support `requiresConfirmation`. Added a security subtitle to `SectionForm.tsx` and disabled the "Save Section" button until all sensitive pre-filled fields (QA-23, QA-39) are explicitly confirmed. Verified via Playwright: pre-filled states show unchecked badges, submit gate is active, editing unchecks the confirmation, and re-confirming re-enables save. (Commit: `edd86f3`)

---

## SESSION S9, S10 & S11 — Tier 3 Data Architecture Completion (June 5, 2026)
- **Completed S9**: Timeline single source of truth — separated `working_target_date` (planning) from `confirmed_interview_date` (hard anchor). Built `src/lib/timeline-service.ts` to calculate backward deadlines and update the compliance calendar. Added Playwright verification for range → specific date transitions. (Commit: `00a6eba`)
- **Completed S10**: Tab B / Tab L shared document overlap fix. Added `sharedTabs` and `crossTabNote` to `ChecklistItem`. Created `CrossTabNote` component with collapsible inline gold-styled info note. Playwright verified expand/collapse behavior. (Commit: `ea108d6`)
- **Completed S11**: Analysis Engine + Confidence Score Integration. Replaced duplicate confidence score calculations. Created `src/lib/score-sync.ts` to read directly from `case_briefs` table. Added `/score` page showing dimensions, "Last assessed" timestamp, significant change banner, and legal disclaimer. Playwright tests added. (Commit: `7cf5a10`)

---
